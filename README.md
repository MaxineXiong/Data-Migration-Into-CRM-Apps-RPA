This repository contains an **RPA (Robotic Process Automation)** solution developed using **[UiPath Automation Platform](http://www.uipath.com)**. The RPA robot is designed to automate repetitive and time-consuming data entry tasks to streamline customer data entry into both CRM web and desktop applications simultaneously. By utilizing UiPath's automation capabilities, this project aims to drastically improve efficiency and accuracy, reducing manual data entry efforts that would take hours for humans to complete down to just a few minutes.

_You can check out the **automation demo** below_:
